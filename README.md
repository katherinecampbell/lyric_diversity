### python scripts to acertain lexical diversity of song lyrics and POS  diversity in short stories

"Lyrics in modern popular music are simplistic and repetitive. Classic songs have so much more diversity."   

A prime example used to back up this statement is Ed Sheeran's 'Shape of You', which repeats "I'm in love with your body" over and over. The lexical diversity of this song is only 0.21. 

Moving from pop music - another example is Rage Against the Machine's 'Killing in the Name', which scores a measly 0.076. 

This is an attempt to counter the quoted argument : Find 2 classic songs which have a lower lexical diversity, and 2 modern songs with high lexical diversity. Eventually the library of avaiable lyrics could be significantly expanded into a silly fun fun app. BeautifulSoup parser was used to scrape the lyrics.
